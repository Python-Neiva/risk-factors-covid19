# Abstract

What are the risk factors that
increase the mortality of Covid-
19 patients? The risk factors for
this disease are important for
health professionals to
understand. They need to know
the likelihood that a patient will
die, so they can give special
attention to those patients. This
project will investigate the
specific risk factors for SARS-
CoV-2 patients in Colombia. We
will use data analysis which
include as collection,
transformation, and analysis of
data. We will apply machine
learning techniques such as
graph clustering to find the major
risk factors for Covid-19 patients.

# Background

Sars-Cov-2 is a disease that
affects people's health, and it is
easily transmitted. Many
research has been done since it
appeared in Asia and affected
Europe and almost the entire
world.
The recent technologies in Big
Data make it possible to analyze
large amounts of information and
get insight from the raw data. The
data analysis technology is now
being applied to health science
and became a powerful tools to
health professionals. So far, the
number of research articles on
COVID-19 according to the
Global Literature on Coronavirus
Disease is 243,990. The number
of these articles related to data
analysis is 3,293. These articles
try to identify common
comorbidities associated with
covid 19 patients.
